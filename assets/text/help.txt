puzzle consists of a 6 Ã— 6 grid with 
several brown blocks, and one red block 
inside the grid. Each (brown and red) 
block occupies either two or three adjacent 
grid spaces. In addition, the blocks must be 
placed either vertically or horizontally. 
The red block is always horizontally placed 
in the third row. A block can only be moved 
up and down if placed vertically and only 
left and right if placed horizontally, and 
it cannot be moved into an already occupied 
space. The goal of the game is to move the 
blocks in such a way that the red block can 
exit the grid
